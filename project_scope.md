Project Title:
Loud Notification Email App for IT Team

Objective:
To develop a mobile application that provides loud notifications for critical emails received during non-working hours to ensure the IT team can respond promptly.

Key Features:

Email Integration:
Connect to email service providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) using APIs or IMAP.
Define rules/filters for what constitutes a "critical" email (e.g., certain senders, subjects, or flagged as high priority).
Notifications:
Trigger loud sound alerts or vibrations when a critical email is received.
Override silent mode or Do Not Disturb settings where permissible.
Customizable alert sounds and vibration patterns.
User Settings:
Configure which emails trigger notifications.
Set active hours for notifications (e.g., from 10 PM to 6 AM).
Enable/disable notifications and customize volume levels.
Platform:
Develop for both iOS and Android (using cross-platform tools like Flutter or React Native).
Backend:
Implement a mechanism to periodically check for new emails (or use push notifications if available).
Testing and Feedback:
Test under various conditions and gather feedback from users to iterate and improve the application.
Technical Considerations:

Ensure the app is battery and data-efficient.
Maintain user privacy and data security in line with company policies.
Deployment:

Internal distribution through platforms like TestFlight (iOS) and direct APKs or an enterprise solution for Android.
Additional Notes:

Collect feedback, identify issues, and iterate the app for better performance and user experience.
